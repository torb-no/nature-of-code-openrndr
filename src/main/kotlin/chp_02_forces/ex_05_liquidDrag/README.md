# Forces - Exercise 2.5

> Take a look at our formula for drag again: 
> drag force = coefficient * speed * speed. 
> The faster an object moves, the greater the 
> drag force against it. In fact, an object 
> not moving in water experiences no drag at all. 
> Expand the example to drop the balls from different 
> heights. How does this affect the drag as they hit the water?
